    STEP 2: Each eliminated player in turn order from whoever drew the card chooses one option below:

    STEP 2a: Steal a card ar random from each active player and then play one of those cards or Reckless abandon if possible

    STEP 2b: Roll the wind die thrice and place a fire gem in each direction indicated without changing the general wind direction
